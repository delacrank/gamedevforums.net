After around 2 and a half months I finally, finished deploying my web forum. It was really fun done using no libraries or frameworks just pure php, javascript, css and mysql. 

The site contains a templating system, private messaging system, friend list, image processing system, an authentication system, password retrieval features, and of course a message board/forum. 

Some work still needs to be done on the UI and some security features need to be added. Recently work on getting the site to work on mobile has been completed.
